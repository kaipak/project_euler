## A comment
My solutions for problems posed on https://projecteuler.net/. All solutions are done with 
either Python or the old fashioned analytical way with pencil and paper (or in the digital 
sense, with LaTeX). I avoid using any libraries or built-in functions (LCM, prime 
factorization, etc.) as doing so renders many of the problems trivial. I gave myself a pass 
on using helper functions such as sort, or min/max.

Finally, I'm not providing answers in the repo although clearly, you could just run the thing 
yourself and have it spit out the answer for you. Hopefully, no one will really resort to this
sort of thing as it takes the fun out of it.

Happy solving!
